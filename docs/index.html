                        <p class="text-faded mb-4">When I was 7 years old, I had a neighbors who palyed all kinds of music, from salsa to boleros. There was a song that they repeated many times in a day called "El deber" by Pedro Arroyo. At that moment, I dindn't pay much attention to that song but it remained in my subconscious.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-faded mb-4">During my adolescence, I always had that song in my mind but I did not know what was its name. Occasionally, I listen to the song in some bars but I was always busy to go and ask the name of the song.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-faded mb-4">One day, while walking through my neighborhood with a friend, I hear a neighbor play that song and immediately I went to him and asked the name, he told and gave me information about the album and other songs related to the author.</p>

                        <p class="text-faded mb-4 text-secondary">When I was child, besides watching cartoons I liked to watching MTV. At that time, Gorillaz released a new song called "clint Eastwood". MTV used to repeat the song many times a day, and every time they put it on TV I listened to it because I liked the rhythm.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-faded mb-4 text-secondary">Gorillaz was a group that had been born in 1998 but until 2001 they had not had good song releases, in addition, the pop boom did not allow other rhythms to emerge, however, this new song was quickly introduced to the music market.</p>

                        <p class="text-faded mb-4">When I was 12 years old, I started to like electronic music. I remember that I started listening to DJs like Gigi D'Agostino, Tiesto, Mauro Picotto, among others. I liked watching them when played in concerts and people applauded and danced to the rhythm of the mixes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-faded mb-4">Although the djs of the time began to release songs focused on electro house, I was fascinated with the first rhythms such as techno, trance and hardcore. These rhythms were still famous at that time and I remember that there was a song that had been very famous called "Kernkraft 400" by Zombie Nation. Listening to this song motivated me to be a dj, to play songs where people danced to the rhythm of the beats.  
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-faded mb-4">When I was 18 years old, I started playing salsa, merengue and vailable rhythms in Cali's night clubs because. I realized that the music scene of Cali had no place for other genres until a friend told me about an event called Convulxion, where djs played underground electronic picking up rhythms from the 80's and 90's
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-faded mb-4">
                        I also started to know djs that taught me about other less conventional rhythms such as psychotrance, future house and videogame sounds that had now become in electronic music.
